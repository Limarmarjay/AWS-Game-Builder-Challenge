## Overview
For this challenge, we will...
- Create an innovative game that shows our creativity, originality, and utilization of AWS services.
- Use Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant, to build our game faster. 
- Use other AWS services of your choosing in your game: for example AWS Amplify Hosting to deploy a web-based game, Amazon S3 for storing game assets, Amazon DynamoDB to store game data, or Amazon Bedrock to add generative AI capabilities. 

## Requirements
### What to Build: 
Entrants must build a game using Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant, to speed up development, and at least one additional AWS service within your game.

### What to Submit:
- Must include a text description that explains how you used Amazon Q Developer, any other AWS services you used, the features, functionality, and the intended purpose of your game.
- Provide a URL to your code repository for judging and testing. The repository must be public.

- Optional: Provide feedback on your experience building with AWS, you can submit multiple times for different services
- Optional: Submit a blog post about how you built your game on community.aws using the tag “game-challenge”
- Optional: a demonstration video of your Project. The video portion of the Submission should be less than 3 minutes should include footage that shows the intended interaction with your application if included, should be uploaded to and made publicly visible on YouTube or Vimeo, and a link to the video should be provided on the submission form on the Hackathon Website; and must not include third-party trademarks, or copyrighted music or other material unless the Entrant has permission to use such material.

## Initial Idea
The initial idea is to create a hopscotch game that is similar to Subway Surfers where a player is going through the game as far as possible.
